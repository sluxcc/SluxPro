1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be Gay.

   Being Gay includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being Gay.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER Gay.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a Gay kid would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY Gay. Fix the problem yourself. A non-Gay would submit the fix back.
